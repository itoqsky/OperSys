Spacing out requests for the same page makes it more probable that when one is needed again,
it has already been loaded, which results in the worst hit rate.

By doing the opposite, or grouping similar page calls together,
you can increase the likelihood that the pages will be loaded when they are needed again and get the highest hit rate.
